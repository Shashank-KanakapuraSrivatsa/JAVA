Question
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPB uses different web technologies on different sites. Below is a fictive example of technologies 
that can be found on the UPB website:

https://upb.de/site/drupal -> Drupal, Apache, PHP5, RedHat
https://upb.de/site/drupal/a -> Drupal, Apache, PHP5, RedHat
https://upb.de/site/drupal/a/b -> Drupal, Apache, PHP5, RedHat
https://upb.de/site/drupal/a/c -> Drupal, Apache, PHP5, RedHat
https://upb.de/site/drupal/a/d/e -> Drupal, Apache, PHP5, RedHat
https://upb.de/site/drupal/f -> Drupal, Apache, PHP5, RedHat
https://upb.de/site/drupal/g -> Drupal, Apache, PHP5, RedHat, AngularJS
https://upb.de/site/jml -> Joomla, Apache, PHP4, AngularJS
https://upb.de/site/jml/pdfs -> PDF generator
https://upb.de/site/ -> Apache, PHP5

We would like to simplify those results to report only the differences between the technologies 
contained in a directory and its parent. 
For example, if Apache is used in https://upb.de/site/drupal/a and in https://upb.de/site/, 
it should only be reported for https://upb.de/site/. 
The simplified results of the list above would look like the following:

https://upb.de/site/ -> Apache, PHP5
https://upb.de/site/drupal/ -> Drupal, RedHat
https://upb.de/site/drupal/g -> AngularJS
https://upb.de/site/jml -> Joomla, PHP4, AngularJS
https://upb.de/site/jml/pdfs -> PDF generator

Write a working Java program that does the simplification 
(it should take the first list as input, and output the second list), 
and writes at least five test cases which verify that your program works. 
Send us your program and test cases, along with a short paragraph on how to run them.
